Addon to combat Fake News

The Idea is to create an ecosystem of active news consumers who exercise healthy skepticism and active debunkers of fake news.
Fight the problem of fake news.

# Version 1.0 Goal:

Whenever there is a fake news in the active tab, the add-on will show a popup there, and say something like this, "This article/news is found to be fake by XXX and you can find more info about this at XXX). 

## We blacklist and greylist websites which publish fake news. Why are we doing this?

We want users to excercise healthy skeptism whenever they consume information from an unknown/unofficial source. To encourage it we are building this addon which will remind you of just that when user is consuming information from questionable sources.

Websites are greylisted of blacklisted based on how frequently they produce fake news.


# Blacklist - more than 3 fake news in the past year:



# Greylist: - more than 1 fake news in the past year:
